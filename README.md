# u-boot_tp-link-sources (repository for u-boot sources taken from GPL TP-Link routers sources)

This is a repository of u-boot GPL code extracted from original TP-Link GPL sources.

1) Their name start with a number telling the priority of the sources (in case of duplicated sources)

2) The name contains also the router names of the related sources

Here you can find 

- the cloned repository of u-boot project (u-boot-DAS)

- the cloned repository of u-boot-pepe2k project (u-boot-mod)

My actual pourpose is to merge the closed pepe2k project with the tp-link sources in my repository.


Future project could be to do the merge with u-boot-DAS repository  (u-boot project)
