05/04/2023: Added "create.sh" script

    to create cscope, tags and codequery databases to check and compare the sources.

    The databases are in the root directory, and specific tags, cscope and codequery database are putted in any source directory too.

    NOTE: adding new directory sources the directory name had to start with anything before "u-boot_" and ending with the BOARD name.
